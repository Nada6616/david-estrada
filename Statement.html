  Hello! My name is David and This is my website where I display a variety of art pieces that I've created! I am an artist in many different forms and mediums of art.
  I like to explore the entire genre of Art and create all sorts of art that  challenges me to continue imporivng and exploring different techniques and skills.
<br>
<br>
I like to make art from all sorts of genres and mediums. I go from working with photography and film to hand crafting and hand drawing to computer illustration and design. I enjoy mixing up my art time after time and allow there to be some diversity within my artwork, and it even allows me to never get tired of creating new art, because I can just go to another medium for a while and continue to play around and make some fresh art. I also tend to get these new ideas I would’ve never thought of if it weren’t for me exploring another medium of art. Overall, I find myself always learning and experimenting with what I know and with what I have as well as discovering new ideas with what I didn’t have at the time.
