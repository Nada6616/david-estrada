I didn’t really plan on having a significant meaning to my piece and instead played around with images and tools until I created something I like. My piece isn’t something to be taken too seriously but rather to have the viewer enjoy the piece for its aesthetics and keep the eyes engaged with the variety of objects and subjects in the piece.

My only goal was to create a very relaxed vibe to my piece. To achieve this, I added images and subjects that represent peacefulness. For instance, the astronaut floats calmly in space, the soft relaxed clouds, and the gentleness of a butterfly. While it may be a cluster of images, it still draws that relaxed vibe I was trying to achieve.
